abstractTitle: "Understanding the International Space Station Crew Perspective Following Long Duration Missions: <br>Data Analytics and Visualization of Crew Feedback"
abstract: "This presentation will discuss how the use of an analytical framework in conjunction with the current human interface, improved the understanding of the International Space Station (ISS) crew perspective data and shortened analysis time, allowing for more informed decisions and rapid development of improvements. These data analytics and visualization methods significantly optimize valuable ISS post flight crew debrief qualitative data, yielding results that can be applied to both current and future spaceflight design and development, and other domains. This presentation will discuss a collaboration that has allowed a team of Human Factors engineers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) to analyze and share data in a more automated and accurate fashion, thanks to the efforts of the JSC Chief Knowledge Office (CKO). Trends are no longer manually derived and are visualized effectively to assist in presenting these evolving techniques and subsequent results to an ever-growing population of human spaceflight end users."
