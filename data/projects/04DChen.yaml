abstractTitle: "Functions: using, writing, and non-standard!!"
abstract: "Functions are a key component in making your code readable, modular, and sharable.
Let's write functions in R, use them, and apply them to data.
The tidyverse purrr library provides a way to map functions in a pipeline.

Life moves on as expected until you plan to incorporate your own functions while using tidyverse functions.
All of a sudden you can no longer pass in strings from your function to the tidyverse functions in the function body because of non-standard evaluation (NSE).
Let's demystify NSE, so you can get back to coding!!
