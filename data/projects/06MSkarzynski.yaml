abstractTitle: How to write respectful and empathic code and documentation
abstract: You can tell a lot about a person by the code and documentation they write (or don't write). In this talk, you'll hear about best practices and workflows for R packages, projects, and scripts that demonstrate respect and empathy for users. Along the way, you'll learn how your work can encourage contributors and promote the development of aspiring data scientists and budding software developers in the R community and beyond.
