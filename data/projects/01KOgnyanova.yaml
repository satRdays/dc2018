abstractTitle: "Network analysis and visualization in R"
abstract: "This talk will discuss the use of network analysis and visualization
tools in R to gain social and research insights. Network science is a
rapidly growing area that allows us to understand the dynamics of
interconnected systems: social, digital, physical, biological, economic,
political, and others. Contemporary network research examines
increasingly large and complex digital trace datasets. Seeking new and
effective ways to examine and present such information has become a
priority in many areas of science, journalism, and the industry. In all
of those spaces, R is the platform of choice for statistical network
models. Examining and visualizing networks in R provides a powerful way
to deliver insights to experts, policy-makers, and lay audiences."
