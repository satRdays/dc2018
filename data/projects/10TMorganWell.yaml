abstractTitle: "3D mapping, plotting, and printing with rayshader"
abstract: "Is there ever a place for the third dimension in visualizing data? Is the 3D pie chart truly bad, or just misunderstood? In this talk, I will show you how you can create beautiful 3D maps and visualizations with the rayshader package. In addition, I will talk about the value of 3D plotting, how interactions with the R community helped drive the development of rayshader, and how writing/blogging about your projects can vastly improve your code. And, of courseâ€”lots of beautiful 3D maps and figures."
