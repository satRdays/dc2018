description: "Gwynn is interested in addressing methodological problems that arise from practical questions and in analysis of longitudinal data in clinical studies. Her PhD research focused on both. She demonstrated that a feasible design does not exist that tests for carryover effects after cessation of treatments when diagnosis is defined by a noisy measurement crossing a threshold. As this was not possible, she analyzed simulated data from trials to determine the same.
