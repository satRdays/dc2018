description: "Gwynn Sturdevant uses data to improve transportation. At Volanno, she improves estimates
of flight and train arrival times. Using sentiment analysis, she analyzes twitter and facebook
posts to facilitate car purchases. Prior to this, gwynn completed a post-doctoral fellow with Ken
Kleinman (University of Massachusetts Amherst and Harvard University) where she developed
an extensive Shiny application to assist in balancing trials. Gwynn has a PhD in Statistics from
University of Auckland, the birthplace of R, where she studied under Thomas Lumley and Ross
Ihaka. For her PhD, she focused on finding long-term effects, after cessation of treatments,
when noisy measurements cross a threshold (blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes). Prior
to her PhD, Gwynn taught high school math and Spanish. She has a Masters in Mathematics
from Northern Arizona University, a BA from St Maryâ€™s College of Maryland, and Diploma in
Teaching (Secondary) from the University of Auckland.

abstractTitle: "How to build a racist AI without trying"
abstract: "In this talk, gwynn will use sentiment analysis and build a model that exposes the ethnic biases
in data sets commonly used to train algorithms. Correcting this will involve using training data
from ConceptNet, an open source semantic network from MIT, as well as the reticulate
package, to incorporate Python datasets into an R environment. A theme of this talk is the
ethical responsibility data scientists have when developing algorithms to reduce bias."
